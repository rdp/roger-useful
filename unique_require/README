unique_require helps you only require a file only once in Ruby 1.8.x

background:

If you've ever gotten a message like
../smart_require/test.rb:1: warning: already initialized constant A


you know that ruby 1.8.x "re-requires" a file if you pass in a different paths to the same file, like
require 'test.rb'
and
require '../current_dir/test.rb'

results in said file being loaded twice.

Ruby 1.9 overcomes this.
This file overcomes this for 1.8.x
ex:

c:\dev>ruby example_bad.rb
../dev/test.rb:1: warning: already initialized constant A

C:\dev\>ruby -runique_require example_bad.rb
# no warning is displayed
